# Renovate-Beirut
Renovate Beirut is a landing page for a campaign that was gathering donations post Beirut Explosion to help renovate the damaged houses and places.

**Motivation**

I knew that Renovate Beirut were looking for a landing page for their site that gathers donations.I was living away from Beirut and wasn't able to go there to volunteer daily on-groud to help with the post-explosion relief process. Thus, I took this oppurtunity to use my web development and design skills to design this landing page and also contributing good to my society. I did this page with one of my friends.

The landing page was built using Bootstrap 4 and basic CSS stylesheets.
